This is not a standalone theme. This is a Hugo theme component or
module.

* Installing this component
** Install as a Hugo Module
*** Requirements
You need to install the latest version of Go from
https://go.dev/doc/install because this theme component requires [[https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/][~hugo
mod ..~ commands]] to work.

This update on switch to using Hugo Modules was last tested with Hugo
v0.92.0.
*** Steps
Add this to your site's TOML config file:

#+begin_src conf-toml
[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-debugprint"
#+end_src
*** To update this component
Run the below command from your Hugo site's directory:

#+begin_src shell
hugo mod get -u
#+end_src
** Install as repository below ~themes~
1. Clone this repo to ~your-site/themes/hugo-debugprint~ directory.
2. Add "hugo-debugprint" as the left-most element of the ~theme~ list
   variable in your site's or theme's ~config.toml~. Example:
   #+begin_example
   theme = ["hugo-debugprint", "my-theme"]
   #+end_example
